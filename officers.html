            Hi y’all! My name is Haoyu Jia and I'm a fourth-year electrical engineering student from China.
            As Club President I’m the one who work with campus admin to make sure that the club runs smoothly.
            I’m also the Weekend Events coordinator, which includes hosting our yearly campus convention Animefest.
            If you have any feedback regarding the club or just want to talk about school/life, feel free to talk
            with me and I'll be happy to chat!
            <br><br>
            I’m usually busy with academics and running the club, but I do spend a lot of my free time on Final
            Fantasy XIV (BRD/SCH main). For anime I'm partial to anything with romance and/or drama, and favorite
            anime include Haruhi, Saekano, and Zombieland Saga (though I'm generally down to watch anything).
            Outside of the otaku hobbies I also casually follow the NFL and am a huge motorsports fan, so I am the
            type of person who'll wake up at 5AM to catch a Formula 1 race live.
            <br><br>
            Hope you guys will enjoy anime club!

          I am a Computer Science major and I am big fan of reading, working
          out, and listening to music. Also an enthusiast of weird and bizarre Internet
          culture. If you ever need a music or book recommendation; I'm your guy!
          <br><br>
          Some of my favourite anime are Gurren Lagann, Ping Pong, and 3-gatsu.
          Manga I love are One Piece, Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa, Bakuman, Eyeshield 21,
          Houseki no Kuni, and JoJo's.

          Hey everyone. I'm Gladys and I'm a second-year Muir student studying
          molecular biology. I'm the person in charge of running the planning committee for our annual convention, Animefest. What the job entails is basically leading the volunteers to efficiently contribute and assist the officers in running Animefest.
          <br><br>
          As for my interest, one of them is obviously anime. The ones I'm really into right now are Haikyuu!! and Boku no Hero Academia but I also like Death Note, Angel Beats!, Samurai Champloo, Houseki no Kuni, Shokugeki no Souma and the list goes on from there.
          <br><br>
On top of that I'm really into video games. Anyone who knows me probably knows
I'm obsessed with the Persona series (completed 3, 4, and 5, playing 2, and
putting Revelations on hold), but I'm still interested in playing other SMT titles. Besides that, I play other games like Tekken, Overwatch, GTA, even down to the Sims. Feel free to come up to me if you ever want to just chat about anime and gaming or even play some matches together. I hope you all have fun being a part of Cal Animage Beta this year!

major here at UCSD. As Internal PR I am responsible for overseeing the wellbeing
of club members and their relationship with each other and the officer board. So
feel free to forward any complaints or questions to me and I'll do my best to

          <br><br>
          In terms of anime I don't have a specific genre that I'm fond of, but some of my favorite series include Tanya the Evil, Konosuba, Land of the Lustrous and One Punch Man. Outside of anime I play a lot of games and read, not really picky about what I read though.
          <br><br>
          I hope you all have a good time in CAB.

          year! I’ll basically watch any anime, but I do like a good isekai and magical girls are my jam. When I’m
          not watching anime, I’m probably writing a story or learning languages or sleeping. Aside from anime,
          I consume a lot of YouTube, and like other Japanese media like tokusatsu. Looking forward to a great

            I tend to love watching anime with interesting visuals and animation, especially
            from directors like Masaaki Yuasa and Hiroyuki Imaishi. I'm also a voracious
            reader of manga, and some of my top favorites include Dr. Stone and Berserk.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I'm a huge fan of video games, and I'll be more than happy to chat

          Greetings, My name is Marshall Hatfield and I'm a freshman chemical
          engineering major from the Bay Area. I am an incoming asset manager,
          so I will be keeping track of the club library as well as the
          club-owned merch. As for anime, I am a big fan of the Fate Franchise,
          and an avid FGO player. Besides fate, some of my favorites include the
          Kara no Kyoukai movies, WataMote, Konosuba, and Monogatari. I also
          play a lot of chess and Total War:Rome , so I'd be glad to play if
          anyone wants to.

           Hello. I'm Brian, President of Cal Animage Beta for the 2018-2019 year. I take care of the tech during GBMs and events as well as a bunch of miscellaneous behind-the-scenes logistics - industry contacts, planning meetings, etc.
        <br><br>
        As far as genres go, I have a soft spot for mecha, although I end up finding something good in whatever I watch or read. If I had the time I'd get back into Gunpla, but for now I'm content with a copious amount of Magic: the Gathering (limited and EDH), a degree of Granblue Fantasy, and an arrangement of other video games: currently Smash Ultimate, Bayonetta 2, and Monster Hunter World/GenU. My favorite anime are the two that got me back into the hobby, namely Senki Zesshou Symphogear and Rinne no Lagrange. Favorite (finished) manga would be Hourou Musuko, with Genshiken in a close second. Houseki no Kuni and YuruCamp haven't ended yet, but they'd also be up there. I offer no guarantees, but I hope everyone enjoys their time here as members of Cal Animage Beta.

        I'm Kendrick and I'm your VP for this year. I'm a fourth year
        Revelle college CS major (literally death I know). Been watching
        anime since I was a kid but only really got into it around 2013 with
        Attack on Titan and later Log Horizon and Kill la Kill. Generally
        speaking, I'll watch anything (well-designed/ cute characters a plus) but series in the action genre particularly appeal to me especially if the action is pretty over-the-top. Case in point, my absolute favorite show is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

      <br><br>
        With games, I'm playing FFXIV (Egali Terryn on Goblin, BRD main),
        Granblue Fantasy. My favorite game is probably Metroid Prime, though
        Ocarina in Time comes close. <br><br>

      And with manga my all time favorite (completed) manga is Hoshi no Samidare. My favorite ongoing manga is Kaguya-Sama Wants to be Confessed to!
      <br><br>
     I am low-key idol trash; a huge fan of BanG!Dream! Favorite girl is Sayo, and band, Roselia!
     <br><br>
     That should do it for now. Hope you all enjoy club this year!

        In case you were wondering, my role lies in maintaining the club
        websites and making any art assets the club may freely use.
        <br><br>
        I'm a fourth year Math-Computer Science major here hailing from the
        Bay Area. I watch anime of almost all genres, but I especially enjoy
        anything with action, adventure, sci-fi, mystery, and/or comedy. (I
        grew up watching a lot of shounen anime)
        <br><br>
        Besides watching anime and reading manga during my "spare time when not drowning in school work," I like playing video games (RPGs and stealth games in particular), drawing, dancing, and sleeping in to avoid feeling the guilt from procrastination.

     Greetings, folks. I'm Alexis Cugini and I'm a grad student now. As
     such, I'm not officially an officer (on paper) for this undergrad
     organization. Therefore, I declare my position in the club to be shadow
     government. I mainly update the Facebook page, but I help out with
     whatever needs doing. <br><br>
     I'm open to any genre when it comes to anime and manga. My favorites include Death Parade and Houseki no Kuni.
     <br><br>
     My other obsession is visual novels, especially otome (dating sim)
     games. My favorite VNs include The House in Fata Morgana and
     Psychedelica of the Black Butterfly. In case you haven't guessed, I enjoy emotional suffering.
     <br><br>
     If you have any questions, I'll be happy to talk with you.

        Hey! I'm David O'Neill and I'm in my last year at UCSD for a Media
        degree. I'm also the historian for Cal Animage Beta which mainly involves filming for Animefest for promotional purposes as well as documenting other club events.
        <br><br>
        As far as anime goes, I'll watch any animated movie under the sun
        and I'm a sucker for detailed animation (I'm looking at you,
        Redline) as well as properly thought out deconstructions. Besides
        anime, I spend a lot of time watching live action movies when I'm not filming things myself. Other than that, board games are a huge passion of mine with my current favorites being Spirit Island, Scythe, and Not Alone.
